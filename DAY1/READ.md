# Day 1 – Kicking Off My Python Journey 

Today I officially started learning Python. I set up my environment, ran my first few lines of code, and got a feel for how Python handles basic stuff like variables, numbers, and text.

---

## ✅ Covered Today:
- Used `print()` to display output
- Created variables with different data types:
  - Strings (`"Hello"`)
  - Integers (`10`)
  - Floats (`3.14`)
  - Booleans (`True`, `False`)
- Saw how indentation actually matters in Python — spacing isn’t just for looks here 😄

---

## ✍️ Quick Notes for Myself:
- Python feels readable — not too many symbols or boilerplate.
- I like how I can just assign a value to a variable without declaring its type.
- Accidentally messed up indentation a few times — need to be careful with that.

## 🔜 What’s Next?
Tomorrow, I’ll try out:
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Playing with strings (like slicing or formatting)
- Doing simple math with Python

Trying to keep each day focused but useful. Let’s keep the streak going 🚀
